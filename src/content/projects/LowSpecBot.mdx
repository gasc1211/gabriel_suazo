# LowSpecBot & LowSpecBotRust

It's a discord server bot for functions like user administration and other miscellaneous tasks we've found with my friends. Through this project I’ve learned about asynchronous development in JavaScript applications and event driven development.

## Technologies Used

- **Discord.js** for the original version implemented in JavaScript with node.js and Serenity for the newer **rust** version.
- Other technologies: git for version control, **GitHub** for collaboration and **GitHub actions** for CI/CD.

Through this experience I also learned about version control and collaborative development through GitHub.
