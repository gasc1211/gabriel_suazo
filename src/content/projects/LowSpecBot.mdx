# LowSpecBot & LowSpecBot-Rust

It consists of a web app for the physics faculty at **UNAH** to manage the lending process of books from their library to students. My work here has mainly been on the backend side, working in typescript with express and drizzle. This was one of my first experiences with modern ORMs and cloud deployment of applications.

## Technologies used:

- **Bun** and **express** for the backend.
- **Drizzle** for managing the database.
- **Zod** for input validation.

Through this project I’ve learned more about how to scale an application for production and implementation of user authentication through **JWT**.
