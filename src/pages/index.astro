			Hello I'm Gabriel, a software developer and Computational Systems Engineer student at <Link href="https://unah.edu.hn" target="_blank">UNAH</Link>.
			Passionate for copmuter related stuff and videogames.
			<br><br>
			In addition to my academic endeavors, I actively seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and enhance my skills. I have participated in hackathons, robotics competitions, and software development events, where I’ve had the chance to tackle real-world challenges and collaborate with other professionals in the field. I also regularly enroll in online courses to stay updated on emerging technologies and industry trends. This continuous commitment to learning and innovation enables me to quickly adapt to new environments and contribute creative, practical solutions to any project.
