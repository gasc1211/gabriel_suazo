		<p>
			Hello I'm Gabriel, a software developer and Computational Systems Engineer student at UNAH.
			Passionate for copmuter related stuff and videogames. Often known as *gasc1211* online.
			
			In addition to school, I also seek for other opportunities to expand my knowledge and improve
			my skills. I have attended to hackathons, contests and events in robotics, software development
			and more. Additionally I regularly take online courses from time to time to keep up to date with
			technologies I find interesting.
